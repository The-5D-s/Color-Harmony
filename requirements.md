# Software Requirements

## Vision

Our vision is to create a helpful tool to extract colors from pictures in real time so we enable users to experience the color varieties around them.

### Problem domain

Color Harmony can extract all prominent colors from any photo/image. It shows color palette including hex codes and populations. You can use colors as you want. You can save or share color palette together with image.

### Importance of this project

Make it easier for anyone wants to process an image to generate a color palette from it, instead of taking the picture and try to find a web app to do so.

## Scope (In/Out)

### IN - What will our project do:
* Users (individuals) can take picture with the camera app and generate a color palette using it.
* Users (individuals) can upload an image from their devices and generate a color palette using it.
* Users can see similar color palettes to the ones they are generating.


### OUT - What will our project not do:
*  Our project won't be a color picker app.
*  We won't offer a color diagram.
*  We won't make a color mixer.


### MVP

Our project MVP will be processing images in order to extract colors from it.

### Stretch Goals

1. We will try to expand our app and create a community that you can share your generated palettes.
2. We will try to make themes for the app.
3. We will try to add a support section, that users can use to contact us if they had a complaint or an inquiry.

# Non-Functional Requirements

## Security

We will use the available authorizations and authentication methods to ensure that our user's data are safe and verified, we will be using `Cognito`, which will manage the site data and will authenticate current users on login.

## Usability

We will make the website user-friendly as much as we can, by making the navigation easy and designing a rigid structure where every component is smoothly blinding in without any useless additions, we will simulate the user experience through the website and try to plan his path so we can build a well accessibility pages.
